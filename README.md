Required: Arduino UNO, 650nm laser, USB camera, enclosure & a Windows 10/11 PC

It is crucial to begin small to become accustomed with how the technology works, then reconfigure for optimal results. 
cryptanalysis steps:

Know range of nonce to begin to avoid futile activity, set min max value in game state.


A-1. Gauge the range using the slider.

A-2. Set the new range in game state, slider snapping and output space detection.

Repeat steps A-1 & A-2 for scientifc notation reduction of desired target.

B-1. Update the hash function to search the new possibility space.

Since modern computers are slower in comparison to ASICs for the task, it may be useful to reduce the number of cryptanalysis steps by connecting an ASIC.
