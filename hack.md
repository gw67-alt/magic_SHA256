Quantum computers cannot break proof of work for Bitcoin because the nonce doesn't always yield a block, it also requires a temporal value. No matter how fast your rig is, sometimes that simply isn't enough, sure you may compete and dominate, but that won't break transactions...
only need a 4.2GHz BTC miner to examine the nonce feature space in one second. Then with custom firmware/software you could alter the timings according to some timing tolerance by the network for improved hash finding. Yes, you can hack your way to solo mining...
